              <p>
                I am a student at Moringa, here to explore my interests and join the
                largely growing sector of technology to make the world a better
                place. Am also a basketballer thats one of my many hobbies but
                probably the top ranked, am also a light gamer and a car enthusiast.
                <br />
                I one day want to be able to create a system that will cater for
                people who dont have food, am really big on helping people who cant
                really help, themselves just to make the world a better place for
                everyone i believe in equality everyone is equal. We need to help
                each other.
