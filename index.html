            <p>I am a student at Moringa, here to explore my interests and join the largely growing sector of technology to make the world a better place.
                Am also a basketballer thats one of my many hobbies but probably the top ranked, am also a light gamer and a car enthusiast. <br>
            I one day want to be able to create a system that will cater for people who dont have food, am really big on helping people who cant really help,
        themselves just to make the world a better place for everyone i believe in equality everyone is equal. We need to help each other. </p>
