              <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Glenn</span></h1>
              <p>
                I am a student at Moringa, here to explore my interests and join the
                largely growing sector of technology to make the world a better
                place. Am also a basketballer thats one of my many hobbies but
                probably the top ranked, am also a light gamer and a car enthusiast.
                <br />
                I one day want to be able to create a system that will cater for
                people who dont have food, am really big on helping people who cant
                really help, themselves just to make the world a better place for
                everyone i believe in equality everyone is equal. We need to help
                each other.

              <h1><span>About</span></h1>
              <p>Hi am Glenn Nguyo i just finished highschool and joined the outside world looking for ways to survive and decided to persue software devolopment,
                one because its a fast growing market technology is evolving everyday, two because it has always been fascinating for me to be at the front of all of this 
                back in highschool i really hated IT for some years and came to like it in my last years thus drastically changing my career.<br>
                At first i was always seeing myself as playing basketball but i saw the way Kenyan players do not get paid alot thats if they even get paid
                but am hoping and wishing to one day live my dream.<br>
                am a car enthusiast also i really love cars, am those people u walk with and they see a car and get soo excited and to you its just a car, and am an 
                all round athlete or i like to think i have played most of the sports in highschool and even gone for competitions. So ya thats me.
